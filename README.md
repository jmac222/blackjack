# Blackjack
This blackjack site uses the Deck of Cards API to shuffle and pick out cards for the player and dealer. The goal of the game is to get 21 or be closest one to it.

## How To Play
- Simply press the Deal button to shuffle new cards in your deck
- Select Hit to add another card to your deck in attempt to get 21 just be careful you don't go over!
- Select Stand to make the dealer add a card but they do not have to if they have a higher value than you and selcting it twice results in the player losing.
- Selecting Deal again resets the game and gives you new cards
